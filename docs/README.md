# Documentation Index

Welcome to the refreshed documentation set for the TTS Project. These files are intentionally concise so newcomers can understand the system quickly while still giving operators the depth they need for deployment and maintenance.

## Available Documents
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — component breakdowns, data flows, and key design decisions.
- `QUICKSTART.md` — step-by-step instructions for running the stack via Docker or locally.
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` — production checklist covering configuration, scaling, and observability.
- `PROJECT_ANALYSIS.md` — high-level summary of capabilities, performance learnings, and roadmap notes.

## How to Use This Folder
1. Read **Quickstart** if you simply need to boot the stack or reproduce a demo.
2. Consult **Architecture** before modifying the codebase or integrating new services.
3. Follow **Deployment** when promoting the project to staging or production.
4. Review **Project Analysis** for context when planning features, pitching the project, or documenting results.

## Contributing to Documentation
- Keep tone concise and actionable—prefer bullet lists and tables over prose.
- Reference commands exactly as they should be copy/pasted (with backticks).
- Update this index whenever you add or remove a document so the list stays source-of-truth.
- When documenting new features, add both the “how” (usage) and the “why” (design intent) so future contributors can reason about changes.
